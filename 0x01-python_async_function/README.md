## Async and Await Syntax
- Async: 

This keyword is used to define an asynchronous function (a function that can be paused and resumed). You use it when you want to write a function that may take some time to complete, like fetching data from the internet.

- Await: 

Inside an async function, await is used to pause the function until the awaited task is completed. Think of it like saying, "I'll wait here until this task finishes before moving on."
